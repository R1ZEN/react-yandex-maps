# Frequently Asked Questions

<br />

## Is X Supported?

All basic Yandex.Maps API objects and controls are supported. All configuration
options of those objects and all events are supported. For the list of supported
items see ["What Is Supported?" section](/#what-is-supported)

## Can I Render React DOM Components Into Yandex.Maps Balloons or Placemark Icons?

This behavior is not supported out of the box by the library. You can try
rendering them on your own accessing Yandex.Maps API directly, see
[#23](https://github.com/gribnoysup/react-yandex-maps/issues/23),
[#27](https://github.com/gribnoysup/react-yandex-maps/issues/27), and
[#150](https://github.com/gribnoysup/react-yandex-maps/issues/150) for some
examples.

## How To Style Map Container? Why Width and Height Props?

By default you can only control Map container with width and height props. This
is done so that `react-yandex-maps` library can keep track of size changes and
call special Map method to fit the Map UI into available view.

You can opt-out of this behavior by providing your own `style` or `className`
prop to the Map component. Your props will be passed to the Map container node
and the library will ignore the width and height props.

## How To Get Access to Yandex.Maps API Instance?

There are two ways to achieve this:

- Use `onLoad` callback prop on any map component from this library, when
  Yandex.Maps API will finish loading, this callback will be called with API
  instance as the first argument.

- Use [`withYMaps` HOC][withymaps] and create your own custom component with
  full access to Yandex.Maps API as a prop.

## How To Get Object Instance?

To get instance of any Yandex.Maps object that rendered by this library, use can
use `instanceRef` prop. Keep in mind that this will behave as React [callback
refs][]: it will call the ref callback with the Yandex.Maps API object instance
when the component mounts, and call it with `null` when it unmounts.
