# Developing locally (Quick Start)

If you want to work on the library locally:

1. Fork this repository and clone your version of the repo
2. Switch to correct node version

```sh
nvm use
```

3. Install npm dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

When you commit changes, eslint will make sure that there are no linting errors
and prettier will format your code based on the repo settings.

When you push changes, jest will run a set of unit tests to make sure that all
of them are passing.
